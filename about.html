                    Hi, I'm Kaylee! I'm a Computer Science & Business student with a passion for fintech, startups, and technology-driven innovation. 
                    I love blending technical skills with creativity to explore new ways of making a meaningful impact.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of my studies, I enjoy exploring local coffee shops, pressing flowers, and hiking through nature trails. 
                    There's something magical about capturing natureâ€™s beauty and turning it into art.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Music is another big part of my lifeâ€”I love **playing guitar and discovering new sounds**. Whether it's indie, rock, or classical, 
                    I believe every song tells a story, and I love getting lost in those narratives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My journey is about blending **technology, creativity, and adventure**, and I'm always looking for ways to connect with like-minded people 
                    who share similar passions.
                </p>
