        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Kaylee! I'm a **Computer Science & Business student** passionate about **fintech, startups, and digital platforms**. 
            I believe in the power of technology to create new opportunities and bring people together. 
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not coding or studying, youâ€™ll find me **exploring local coffee shops**, searching for the perfect cappuccino, or 
            getting lost in a new hiking trail. I have a deep love for **nature and creativity**, which is why I enjoy **pressing flowers** 
            and making **nature-inspired art**. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Music is another big part of my lifeâ€”I love **playing guitar and discovering new sounds**. 
            Whether it's indie, rock, or classical, I believe every song tells a story, and I love getting lost in those narratives.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey is about blending **technology, creativity, and adventure**, and I'm always looking for ways to **connect with like-minded people** 
            who share similar passions.
        </p>
