                    While my professional interests lie in fintech and data-driven decision-making, I also have a deep appreciation for creativity and exploration. 
                    I love blending technology with art and nature, finding ways to bring balance between structured problem-solving and creative expression.

                    One of my favorite pastimes is pressing flowers and turning them into framed artwork. 
                    This hobby lets me preserve fleeting moments of nature and transform them into something permanent and meaningful. 
                    I find it fascinating how technology and traditional crafts can intersect in unexpected ways, inspiring new ideas and perspectives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to art, I also enjoy:
